Seventh Cleaning:
We have APR DRG Code - 206 categories. It is generallly impossible for us to predict all 206 different types of illnesses. 
Even if we manage to predict 206 illnesses, it will probably overfit our model if we were to use it on our test data. 
Therefore, we want to divide our data into 8 different groups: 
Group 1 to Group 7 are specific diseases and Group 8 is all the remaining diseases. 
The idea of Group 8 is when we predict an illness which is not one of the 7 types we pick, we can use regard it as Group 8. 
The following steps describe how we pick the 8 groups using Within Group Variation.

First, we calculate the standard deviation of entire the data set. SD_entire
We decide to pick rows with APR DRG Code between 3 and 20 (18 groups) to calculate remaining groups' standard 
deviations. 
For example, if we are in our 1st loop which picks APR DRG Code (3), we then calculate the standard deviation of our data
set by removing rows whose APR DRG Code is 3. Let's call it SD1.
If we are in our 2nd loop which picks APR DRG Codes (3 and 4), we then calculate the standard deviation of our data
set by removing rows whose APR DRG Codes are 3 and 4. Let's call it SD2.
We do these steps for 18 loops, which will give us 18 SDs. We compare these 18 SDs with SD_entire. We pick the 7 SDs which are
most close to SD_entire. The corresponding illnesses of the 7 SDs are the 7 Groups.

Data Insepctions
~ Outliers
We have some rows with charges being very small, somewhere between $1 and $100. We think these data are either due to typo
or due to some special situations (for example, change of hospital) which we are not interested in. Therefore, we decide
to remove those rows whose charge is fewer than $500.
