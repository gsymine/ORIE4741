We added a column called "insert column" and renamed these five groups to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

Fourth Cleaning: ~ Ivy Type of Disposition

Fifth Cleaning:
Initially we were unsure whether APR Risk of Mortality is the same as APR Severity of Illness Code, but after checking the data,
we found these are are different. Although they have some differences, the two are highly correlated so we decided to 
use APR Severity of Illness Code as our feature instead of APR Risk of Mortality.

We checked columns of APR Severity of Illness Code and found we have 45 NAs so we thought about deleting these rows. However,
we wanted to check if these rows contained other important information in other columns --- APR risk of mortality and 
APR medical surgical description. We found the two columns also have 45 NAs and they are the same 45 NAs corresponding
to APR Severity of Illness Code. Therefore, it is safe to delete these 45 rows.

Sixth Cleaning:
CCS procedure code - 331 categories
APR DRG Code - 206 categories
